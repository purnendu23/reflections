Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A. When we initialize a repository using 'git init' a new file '.git' is created.
This is done so that git can track the changes we make to this repo from here on.


If you accidentally add a file to the staging area, you can remove it using git reset. 
For example, if you accidentally add lesson_2_reflections.txt, but donâ€™t want it to be committed yet, 
run git reset lesson_2_reflections.txt 
and the file will be removed from the staging area, but it will still be in your working directory.

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A. Staging Area - enables picking only a subset of the changes(files) which are relevant to the next commit.
So, all the files in the staging area are the ones where new feature has been implemented and can be part
of the same commit.
